libevent library
****************

   This manual documents how to use the libevent library for
asynchronous event handling.  It corresponds to version 0.0 (updated in
September, 1996).

Introduction
************

   FIXME general introduction.

   Every event has a generator and a handler.  Only the generator may
signal that the event has occurred, and only the handler can mark
handling as completed.

   Each event is handled either synchronously or asynchronously (FIXME
the generator decides?) -- when a generator signals a synchronous
event, it is handled immediately and the result from the handler is
available on completion; but when an asynchronous event is handled the
generator retains control, and the handler is invoked at some later
stage.  The generator cannot directly obtain the result of the handler
in this case.

   In general, an event handler cannot know in advance whether it can
handle a message immediately or not.

   All events can have timeouts (which are normally set by the
handler).  If it has not occurred within the timeout period, the
timeout handler is called instead of the normal handler.
